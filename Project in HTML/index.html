                <h3>Coffee Trivia</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>When did Coffee first appear in the Phillipines</summary>
                    <p>
                        Coffee was first introduced to the Philippines
                        during the late 17th century. It is believed that
                        coffee seeds were brought to the archipelago by a
                        Spanish Franciscan friar named Pedro de Alfaro, who
                        planted the first coffee tree in the town of Lipa,
                        Batangas. The favorable climate and fertile soil of
                        the Philippines proved to be ideal for coffee cultivation,
                        and the crop quickly thrived. Coffee production grew steadily,
                        and by the 19th century, the Philippines became one of the largest
                        coffee exporters in the world. The coffee industry played a significant
                        role in the country's economy, shaping local communities and contributing
                        to its cultural heritage. However, the industry faced challenges in the
                        20th century due to various factors such as plant diseases and the
                        introduction of more profitable crops, leading to a decline in
                        coffee production. Nevertheless, coffee remains an integral
                        part of Philippine culture, and the country continues to
                        produce and enjoy a diverse range of local coffee varieties.
